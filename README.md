**Project Status | License | Version**

Unifying in-store sales and online commerce into one seamless retail experience.

---

## 📖 Overview

**OneShop** is a cloud-based, multi-tenant **Progressive Web Application (PWA)** developed as an academic full-stack project. It is designed to help small and medium-scale retailers manage **physical store operations and online sales through a single integrated system**.

Unlike traditional POS systems or standalone e-commerce platforms, OneShop ensures **real-time inventory synchronization**, centralized customer management, and consistent sales tracking across both offline and online channels. The system supports uninterrupted sales through offline-first capabilities while maintaining data consistency once connectivity is restored.
